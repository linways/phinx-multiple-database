# Phinx Multiple Databases
## Intro
[Phinx](https://github.com/cakephp/phinx) is handy tool to manage database migrations.
But it does not support running same migrations for different databases. This will be 
really helpful in the case of multi-database multi-tenant applications.
This is a simple "hack" to use Phinx to easily run same migrations over multiple databases.


### Features
* Effortlessly run same migrations on multiple databases. 
* Fake migrations on multiple databases.
